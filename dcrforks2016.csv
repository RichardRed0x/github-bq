The goal is to update btcd proper after each step so it can\ntake advantage of the enhancements as they are developed.\n\nIn addition to the aforementioned benefit, this staged approach has been\nchosen since it is absolutely critical to maintain consensus.\nSeparating the changes into several stages makes it easier for reviewers\nto logically follow what is happening and therefore helps prevent\nconsensus bugs.  Naturally there are significant automated tests to help\nprevent consensus issues as well.\n\nThe main focus of this stage is to convert the blockchain package to use\nthe new database interface and implement the chain-related functionality\nwhich it no longer handles.  It also aims to improve efficiency in\nvarious areas by making use of the new database and chain capabilities.\n\nThe following is an overview of the chain changes:\n\n- Update to use the new database interface\n- Add chain-related functionality that the old database used to handle\n  - Main chain structure and state\n  - Transaction spend tracking\n- Implement a new pruned unspent transaction output (utxo) set\n  - Provides efficient direct access to the unspent transaction outputs\n  - Uses a domain specific compression algorithm that understands the\n    standard transaction scripts in order to significantly compress them\n  - Removes reliance on the transaction index and paves the way toward\n    eventually enabling block pruning\n- Modify the New function to accept a Config struct instead of\n  inidividual parameters\n- Replace the old TxStore type with a new UtxoViewpoint type that makes\n  use of the new pruned utxo set\n- Convert code to treat the new UtxoViewpoint as a rolling view that is\n  used between connects and disconnects to improve efficiency\n- Make best chain state always set when the chain instance is created\n  - Remove now unnecessary logic for dealing with unset best state\n- Make all exported functions concurrent safe\n  - Currently using a single chain state lock as it provides a straight\n    forward and easy to review path forward however this can be improved\n    with more fine grained locking\n- Optimize various cases where full blocks were being loaded when only\n  the header is needed to help reduce the I/O load\n- Add the ability for callers to get a snapshot of the current best\n  chain stats in a concurrent safe fashion\n  - Does not block callers while new blocks are being processed\n- Make error messages that reference transaction outputs consistently\n  use <transaction hash>:<output index>\n- Introduce a new AssertError type an convert internal consistency\n  checks to use it\n- Update tests and examples to reflect the changes\n- Add a full suite of tests to ensure correct functionality of the new\n  code\n\nThe following is an overview of the btcd changes:\n\n- Update to use the new database and chain interfaces\n- Temporarily remove all code related to the transaction index\n- Temporarily remove all code related to the address index\n- Convert all code that uses transaction stores to use the new utxo\n  view\n- Rework several calls that required the block manager for safe\n  concurrency to use the chain package directly now that it is\n  concurrent safe\n- Change all calls to obtain the best hash to use the new best state\n  snapshot capability from the chain package\n- Remove workaround for limits on fetching height ranges since the new\n  database interface no longer imposes them\n- Correct the gettxout RPC handler to return the best chain hash as\n  opposed the hash the txout was found in\n- Optimize various RPC handlers:\n  - Change several of the RPC handlers to use the new chain snapshot\n    capability to avoid needlessly loading data\n  - Update several handlers to use new functionality to avoid accessing\n    the block manager so they are able to return the data without\n    blocking when the server is busy processing blocks\n  - Update non-verbose getblock to avoid deserialization and\n    serialization overhead\n  - Update getblockheader to request the block height directly from\n    chain and only load the header\n  - Update getdifficulty to use the new cached data from chain\n  - Update getmininginfo to use the new cached data from chain\n  - Update non-verbose getrawtransaction to avoid deserialization and\n    serialization overhead\n  - Update gettxout to use the new utxo store versus loading\n    full transactions using the transaction index\n\nThe following is an overview of the utility changes:\n- Update addblock to use the new database and chain interfaces\n- Update findcheckpoint to use the new database and chain interfaces\n- Remove the dropafter utility which is no longer supported\n\nNOTE: The transaction index and address index will be reimplemented in\nanother commit."",""distinct"":true,""url"":""https://api.github.com/repos/chappjc/dcrd/commits/b6d426241d2dd01af15425652dc4a878b3559779""},{""sha"":""8e71bcf41a9ed7d33dd9e3d87770d2ede0e3b7b9"",""author"":{""name"":""Dave Collins"",""email"":""4b5cc8591e1af5b3606cf32bb53d8e0bf0bb626a@conformal.com""},""message"":""indexers: Implement optional tx/address indexes.\n\nThis introduces a new indexing infrastructure for supporting optional\nindexes using the new database and blockchain infrastructure along with\ntwo concrete indexer implementations which provide both a\ntransaction-by-hash and a transaction-by-address index.\n\nThe new infrastructure is mostly separated into a package named indexers\nwhich is housed under the blockchain package.

The goal is to update btcd proper after each step so it can\ntake advantage of the enhancements as they are developed.\n\nIn addition to the aforementioned benefit, this staged approach has been\nchosen since it is absolutely critical to maintain consensus.\nSeparating the changes into several stages makes it easier for reviewers\nto logically follow what is happening and therefore helps prevent\nconsensus bugs.  Naturally there are significant automated tests to help\nprevent consensus issues as well.\n\nThe main focus of this stage is to convert the blockchain package to use\nthe new database interface and implement the chain-related functionality\nwhich it no longer handles.  It also aims to improve efficiency in\nvarious areas by making use of the new database and chain capabilities.\n\nThe following is an overview of the chain changes:\n\n- Update to use the new database interface\n- Add chain-related functionality that the old database used to handle\n  - Main chain structure and state\n  - Transaction spend tracking\n- Implement a new pruned unspent transaction output (utxo) set\n  - Provides efficient direct access to the unspent transaction outputs\n  - Uses a domain specific compression algorithm that understands the\n    standard transaction scripts in order to significantly compress them\n  - Removes reliance on the transaction index and paves the way toward\n    eventually enabling block pruning\n- Modify the New function to accept a Config struct instead of\n  inidividual parameters\n- Replace the old TxStore type with a new UtxoViewpoint type that makes\n  use of the new pruned utxo set\n- Convert code to treat the new UtxoViewpoint as a rolling view that is\n  used between connects and disconnects to improve efficiency\n- Make best chain state always set when the chain instance is created\n  - Remove now unnecessary logic for dealing with unset best state\n- Make all exported functions concurrent safe\n  - Currently using a single chain state lock as it provides a straight\n    forward and easy to review path forward however this can be improved\n    with more fine grained locking\n- Optimize various cases where full blocks were being loaded when only\n  the header is needed to help reduce the I/O load\n- Add the ability for callers to get a snapshot of the current best\n  chain stats in a concurrent safe fashion\n  - Does not block callers while new blocks are being processed\n- Make error messages that reference transaction outputs consistently\n  use <transaction hash>:<output index>\n- Introduce a new AssertError type an convert internal consistency\n  checks to use it\n- Update tests and examples to reflect the changes\n- Add a full suite of tests to ensure correct functionality of the new\n  code\n\nThe following is an overview of the btcd changes:\n\n- Update to use the new database and chain interfaces\n- Temporarily remove all code related to the transaction index\n- Temporarily remove all code related to the address index\n- Convert all code that uses transaction stores to use the new utxo\n  view\n- Rework several calls that required the block manager for safe\n  concurrency to use the chain package directly now that it is\n  concurrent safe\n- Change all calls to obtain the best hash to use the new best state\n  snapshot capability from the chain package\n- Remove workaround for limits on fetching height ranges since the new\n  database interface no longer imposes them\n- Correct the gettxout RPC handler to return the best chain hash as\n  opposed the hash the txout was found in\n- Optimize various RPC handlers:\n  - Change several of the RPC handlers to use the new chain snapshot\n    capability to avoid needlessly loading data\n  - Update several handlers to use new functionality to avoid accessing\n    the block manager so they are able to return the data without\n    blocking when the server is busy processing blocks\n  - Update non-verbose getblock to avoid deserialization and\n    serialization overhead\n  - Update getblockheader to request the block height directly from\n    chain and only load the header\n  - Update getdifficulty to use the new cached data from chain\n  - Update getmininginfo to use the new cached data from chain\n  - Update non-verbose getrawtransaction to avoid deserialization and\n    serialization overhead\n  - Update gettxout to use the new utxo store versus loading\n    full transactions using the transaction index\n\nThe following is an overview of the utility changes:\n- Update addblock to use the new database and chain interfaces\n- Update findcheckpoint to use the new database and chain interfaces\n- Remove the dropafter utility which is no longer supported\n\nNOTE: The transaction index and address index will be reimplemented in\nanother commit."",""distinct"":false,""url"":""https://api.github.com/repos/chappjc/dcrd/commits/491acd4ca6f88d18afdb0294e3899257140c0df0""},{""sha"":""7c174620f7631612bd73d9f9f1df6e1afcb0f9c9"",""author"":{""name"":""Dave Collins"",""email"":""4b5cc8591e1af5b3606cf32bb53d8e0bf0bb626a@conformal.com""},""message"":""indexers: Implement optional tx/address indexes.\n\nThis introduces a new indexing infrastructure for supporting optional\nindexes using the new database and blockchain infrastructure along with\ntwo concrete indexer implementations which provide both a\ntransaction-by-hash and a transaction-by-address index.\n\nThe new infrastructure is mostly separated into a package named indexers\nwhich is housed under the blockchain package.

This\nmeans that for a relay fee of 1e3 satoshis/kB, a 500 byte transaction\nis only required to pay a 5e2 satoshi fee and a 1500 byte transaction\nonly need pay a 1.5e3 fee.

This has switched to\nusing worst case transaction size estimates rather than best case, and\nsigning is only performed once.\n\nTransaction input signature creation has switched from using\ntxscript.SignatureScript to txscript.SignTxOutput.  The new API is\nable to redeem outputs other than just P2PKH, so the previous\nrestrictions about P2SH outputs being unspendable (except through the\nsignrawtransaction RPC) no longer hold.\n\nSeveral new public packages have been added:\n\nwallet/txauthor - transaction authoring and signing\nwallet/txfees - fee estimations and change output inclusion\nwallet/txrules - simple consensus and mempool policy rule checks\n\nAlong with some internal packages:\n\nwallet/internal/txsizes - transaction size estimation\ninternal/helpers - context free convenience functions\n\nThe txsizes package is internal as the estimations it provides are\nspecific for the algorithms used by these new packages."",""distinct"":false,""url"":""https://api.github.com/repos/jolan/dcrwallet/commits/f084802fecc36ce410df6f287b6dc4a8d231a597""},{""sha"":""397beadfd55ef4a19ffac3f3f33075c14150b4aa"",""author"":{""email"":""616c365f96b8b68cc5e24e6699ebd9189e2a7eb0@gmail.com"",""name"":""Janus Troelsen""},""message"":""Fix spelling in legacy test and docs using aspell"",""distinct"":false,""url"":""https://api.github.com/repos/jolan/dcrwallet/commits/397beadfd55ef4a19ffac3f3f33075c14150b4aa""},{""sha"":""d09c2a84c196a504e36db280fa89d34a338efb18"",""author"":{""email"":""c3d3100ac1d259bc987fcc245095221cd7e91753@companyzero.com"",""name"":""Josh Rickmar""},""message"":""Protect the relay fee field with a mutex.\n\nThis prevents races when setting a new relay fee through the legacy\nRPC server (settxfee).\n\nFixes #379."",""distinct"":false,""url"":""https://api.github.com/repos/jolan/dcrwallet/commits/d09c2a84c196a504e36db280fa89d34a338efb18""},{""sha"":""24fc8bb6c5b61a159880c6f61009a49f25bf1a47"",""author"":{""email"":""c3d3100ac1d259bc987fcc245095221cd7e91753@companyzero.com"",""name"":""Josh Rickmar""},""message"":""Read synchronized relay fee once when checking outputs."",""distinct"":false,""url"":""https://api.github.com/repos/jolan/dcrwallet/commits/24fc8bb6c5b61a159880c6f61009a49f25bf1a47""},{""sha"":""2b79aad79c04768a293fc715e346235b04dafd8b"",""author"":{""email"":""c3d3100ac1d259bc987fcc245095221cd7e91753@companyzero.com"",""name"":""Josh Rickmar""},""message"":""Stop wallet and close wallet DB on interrupt.\n\nThis corrects and simplifies the shutdown logic for interrupts, the\nwalletrpc.WalletLoaderService/CloseWallet RPC, and the legacy stop RPC\nby both stopping all wallet processes and closing the wallet database.\nIt appears that this behavior broke as part of the wallet package\nrefactor, causing occasional nil pointer panics and memory faults when\nclosing the wallet database with active transactions.\n\nFixes #282.\n\nFixes #283."",""distinct"":false,""url"":""https://api.github.com/repos/jolan/dcrwallet/commits/2b79aad79c04768a293fc715e346235b04dafd8b""},{""sha"":""cee0411a2eb69769ffa2bcb43402facc96997f33"",""author"":{""email"":""c3d3100ac1d259bc987fcc245095221cd7e91753@companyzero.com"",""name"":""Josh Rickmar""},""message"":""Default to mainnet.\n\nNote that this is a breaking change since it removes the mainnet\nconfig option, replacing it with a testnet option.

If left there, it will cause linker errors for the multiply defined symbol. The configure.ac file (which generates the configure script) now includes an option to disable the previously mandatory ADL header file checks - this check will error out unconditionally when cross compiling. It may now be disabled by --disable-adl-checks, which defaults to off (meaning the checks stay on by default.) The configure script also now will not assume winpthread is the ONLY kind of pthread library you can use on Windows, and will check for both winpthreads and a REAL Windows pthreads library (like pthreads-w32, which I use because it supplies more of the pthread library than winpthreads) - it will then handle linking accordingly, i.e. -lwinpthread in the former case, and -lpthread in the latter.

This\nmeans that for a relay fee of 1e3 satoshis/kB, a 500 byte transaction\nis only required to pay a 5e2 satoshi fee and a 1500 byte transaction\nonly need pay a 1.5e3 fee.  The previous code would end up estimating\nthese fees to be 1e3 and 2e3 respectively.\n\nBecause the previous code would add more fee than needed in almost\nevery case, the transaction size estimations were optimistic\n(best/smallest case) and signing was done in a loop where the fee was\nincremented by the relay fee again each time the actual size of the\nsigned transaction rendered the fee too low.  This has switched to\nusing worst case transaction size estimates rather than best case, and\nsigning is only performed once.\n\nTransaction input signature creation has switched from using\ntxscript.SignatureScript to txscript.SignTxOutput.  The new API is\nable to redeem outputs other than just P2PKH, so the previous\nrestrictions about P2SH outputs being unspendable (except through the\nsignrawtransaction RPC) no longer hold.\n\nSeveral new public packages have been added:\n\nwallet/txauthor - transaction authoring and signing\nwallet/txfees - fee estimations and change output inclusion\nwallet/txrules - simple consensus and mempool policy rule checks\n\nAlong with some internal packages:\n\nwallet/internal/txsizes - transaction size estimation\ninternal/helpers - context free convenience functions\n\nThe txsizes package is internal as the estimations it provides are\nspecific for the algorithms used by these new packages."",""distinct"":true,""url"":""https://api.github.com/repos/chappjc/dcrwallet/commits/f084802fecc36ce410df6f287b6dc4a8d231a597""},{""sha"":""397beadfd55ef4a19ffac3f3f33075c14150b4aa"",""author"":{""name"":""Janus Troelsen"",""email"":""07b14fe5c8a58c47aa1e04b36baeb3953df2fb54@gmail.com""},""message"":""Fix spelling in legacy test and docs using aspell"",""distinct"":true,""url"":""https://api.github.com/repos/chappjc/dcrwallet/commits/397beadfd55ef4a19ffac3f3f33075c14150b4aa""},{""sha"":""d09c2a84c196a504e36db280fa89d34a338efb18"",""author"":{""name"":""Josh Rickmar"",""email"":""daf8fdb594b3c38ab93d1ccaee78cf8212ddc036@companyzero.com""},""message"":""Protect the relay fee field with a mutex.\n\nThis prevents races when setting a new relay fee through the legacy\nRPC server (settxfee).\n\nFixes #379."",""distinct"":true,""url"":""https://api.github.com/repos/chappjc/dcrwallet/commits/d09c2a84c196a504e36db280fa89d34a338efb18""},{""sha"":""24fc8bb6c5b61a159880c6f61009a49f25bf1a47"",""author"":{""name"":""Josh Rickmar"",""email"":""daf8fdb594b3c38ab93d1ccaee78cf8212ddc036@companyzero.com""},""message"":""Read synchronized relay fee once when checking outputs."",""distinct"":true,""url"":""https://api.github.com/repos/chappjc/dcrwallet/commits/24fc8bb6c5b61a159880c6f61009a49f25bf1a47""},{""sha"":""2b79aad79c04768a293fc715e346235b04dafd8b"",""author"":{""name"":""Josh Rickmar"",""email"":""daf8fdb594b3c38ab93d1ccaee78cf8212ddc036@companyzero.com""},""message"":""Stop wallet and close wallet DB on interrupt.\n\nThis corrects and simplifies the shutdown logic for interrupts, the\nwalletrpc.WalletLoaderService/CloseWallet RPC, and the legacy stop RPC\nby both stopping all wallet processes and closing the wallet database.\nIt appears that this behavior broke as part of the wallet package\nrefactor, causing occasional nil pointer panics and memory faults when\nclosing the wallet database with active transactions.\n\nFixes #282.\n\nFixes #283."",""distinct"":true,""url"":""https://api.github.com/repos/chappjc/dcrwallet/commits/2b79aad79c04768a293fc715e346235b04dafd8b""},{""sha"":""cee0411a2eb69769ffa2bcb43402facc96997f33"",""author"":{""name"":""Josh Rickmar"",""email"":""daf8fdb594b3c38ab93d1ccaee78cf8212ddc036@companyzero.com""},""message"":""Default to mainnet.\n\nNote that this is a breaking change since it removes the mainnet\nconfig option, replacing it with a testnet option.

This means the data has to be sorted every time it is needed\r\nin order to select a ticket and validate a block.  On my hardware, the\r\nprocess of removing tickets that have been voted and adding new tickets\r\ntakes ~27ms with the current implementation.\r\n\r\nIn order to speed this up, this introduces a new internal package named\r\ntickettreap that provides a tailored treap data structure that is\r\nintended to be used for the in-memory live ticket pool when the new\r\ndatabase and blockchain enhancements have been synced from upstream.\r\nSince it maintains the data in sorted order, it provides a significant\r\nspeedup over the current map-based implementation.  On my hardware, this\r\nimplementation is able to remove the tickets that have voted and add the\r\nnew tickets in ~0.083ms and iterate the entire structure for selecting the\r\ntickets in ~1.88ms for a total of ~1.96ms.  That equates to roughly 14x\r\nfaster access.\r\n\r\nIn addition, it would also be possible for the stake code to keep a map\r\nfor height-based lookups (while still relying on this new data structure\r\nfor keeping the lexicographic sort ordering requirements) for an even\r\ngreater speedup since it would eliminate the need to iterate the\r\nstructure to remove tickets at a given height.\r\n\r\nFinally, when evaluating forks, the current code is quite inefficient\r\nbecause it needs to make a copy of all of the live ticket maps.  This\r\nnew structure provides O(1) snapshot/copy capabilities so it is much\r\nmore efficient in that regard as well.\r\n\r\nBenchmarks:\r\n\r\nImmutableCopy     30000000      40.7 ns/op   0 B/op   0 allocs/op\r\nImmutableIterate  1000       1881738 ns/op   0 B/op   0 allocs/op"",""distinct"":true,""url"":""https://api.github.com/repos/marcopeereboom/dcrd/commits/92635a475e2d53708587eebd63ffde7ead53519e""},{""sha"":""2bbfd5f2507b63331e9505c71857fb2e58784290"",""author"":{""name"":""Alex Yocom-Piatt"",""email"":""d78fb765cc94356bd6d756d98caa3bccbf4fe4e7@decred.org""},""message"":""fix memory allignment for 32-bit architectures (#668) (#269)\n\nhaving 3 int32s above the uint64s in the struct\r\nwill cause misalignment for some 32-bit architectures.\r\nsee https://golang.org/pkg/sync/atomic/#pkg-note-BUG\r\nThis aligns bytesReceived and bytesSent."",""distinct"":true,""url"":""https://api.github.com/repos/marcopeereboom/dcrd/commits/2bbfd5f2507b63331e9505c71857fb2e58784290""},{""sha"":""fa72e214dbf084f7e7f6974eba3592f32401b982"",""author"":{""name"":""Marco Peereboom"",""email"":""b8861d949a418f1cd6fe09603676e34a0f3a51d2@peereboom.us""},""message"":""Don't create .dcrd willy-nilly.\n\nThis interferes with the installer when it tries to detect if the\nrequired .dirs already exist or not.\n\nDebated with jrick and ay-p."",""distinct"":true,""url"":""https://api.github.com/repos/marcopeereboom/dcrd/commits/fa72e214dbf084f7e7f6974eba3592f32401b982""}]}",60284076,marcopeereboom/dcrd,https://api.github.com/repos/marcopeereboom/dcrd,4366787,marcopeereboom,"",https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4366787?,https://api.github.com/users/marcopeereboom,,,,,,2016-06-09 16:30:34 UTC,4125591121,"{""actor"":{""display_login"":""marcopeereboom""}}"

The goal is to update btcd proper after each step so it can\ntake advantage of the enhancements as they are developed.\n\nIn addition to the aforementioned benefit, this staged approach has been\nchosen since it is absolutely critical to maintain consensus.\nSeparating the changes into several stages makes it easier for reviewers\nto logically follow what is happening and therefore helps prevent\nconsensus bugs.  Naturally there are significant automated tests to help\nprevent consensus issues as well.\n\nThe main focus of this stage is to convert the blockchain package to use\nthe new database interface and implement the chain-related functionality\nwhich it no longer handles.  It also aims to improve efficiency in\nvarious areas by making use of the new database and chain capabilities.\n\nThe following is an overview of the chain changes:\n\n- Update to use the new database interface\n- Add chain-related functionality that the old database used to handle\n  - Main chain structure and state\n  - Transaction spend tracking\n- Implement a new pruned unspent transaction output (utxo) set\n  - Provides efficient direct access to the unspent transaction outputs\n  - Uses a domain specific compression algorithm that understands the\n    standard transaction scripts in order to significantly compress them\n  - Removes reliance on the transaction index and paves the way toward\n    eventually enabling block pruning\n- Modify the New function to accept a Config struct instead of\n  inidividual parameters\n- Replace the old TxStore type with a new UtxoViewpoint type that makes\n  use of the new pruned utxo set\n- Convert code to treat the new UtxoViewpoint as a rolling view that is\n  used between connects and disconnects to improve efficiency\n- Make best chain state always set when the chain instance is created\n  - Remove now unnecessary logic for dealing with unset best state\n- Make all exported functions concurrent safe\n  - Currently using a single chain state lock as it provides a straight\n    forward and easy to review path forward however this can be improved\n    with more fine grained locking\n- Optimize various cases where full blocks were being loaded when only\n  the header is needed to help reduce the I/O load\n- Add the ability for callers to get a snapshot of the current best\n  chain stats in a concurrent safe fashion\n  - Does not block callers while new blocks are being processed\n- Make error messages that reference transaction outputs consistently\n  use <transaction hash>:<output index>\n- Introduce a new AssertError type an convert internal consistency\n  checks to use it\n- Update tests and examples to reflect the changes\n- Add a full suite of tests to ensure correct functionality of the new\n  code\n\nThe following is an overview of the btcd changes:\n\n- Update to use the new database and chain interfaces\n- Temporarily remove all code related to the transaction index\n- Temporarily remove all code related to the address index\n- Convert all code that uses transaction stores to use the new utxo\n  view\n- Rework several calls that required the block manager for safe\n  concurrency to use the chain package directly now that it is\n  concurrent safe\n- Change all calls to obtain the best hash to use the new best state\n  snapshot capability from the chain package\n- Remove workaround for limits on fetching height ranges since the new\n  database interface no longer imposes them\n- Correct the gettxout RPC handler to return the best chain hash as\n  opposed the hash the txout was found in\n- Optimize various RPC handlers:\n  - Change several of the RPC handlers to use the new chain snapshot\n    capability to avoid needlessly loading data\n  - Update several handlers to use new functionality to avoid accessing\n    the block manager so they are able to return the data without\n    blocking when the server is busy processing blocks\n  - Update non-verbose getblock to avoid deserialization and\n    serialization overhead\n  - Update getblockheader to request the block height directly from\n    chain and only load the header\n  - Update getdifficulty to use the new cached data from chain\n  - Update getmininginfo to use the new cached data from chain\n  - Update non-verbose getrawtransaction to avoid deserialization and\n    serialization overhead\n  - Update gettxout to use the new utxo store versus loading\n    full transactions using the transaction index\n\nThe following is an overview of the utility changes:\n- Update addblock to use the new database and chain interfaces\n- Update findcheckpoint to use the new database and chain interfaces\n- Remove the dropafter utility which is no longer supported\n\nNOTE: The transaction index and address index will be reimplemented in\nanother commit."",""distinct"":false,""url"":""https://api.github.com/repos/marcopeereboom/dcrd/commits/491acd4ca6f88d18afdb0294e3899257140c0df0""},{""sha"":""7c174620f7631612bd73d9f9f1df6e1afcb0f9c9"",""author"":{""name"":""Dave Collins"",""email"":""4b5cc8591e1af5b3606cf32bb53d8e0bf0bb626a@conformal.com""},""message"":""indexers: Implement optional tx/address indexes.\n\nThis introduces a new indexing infrastructure for supporting optional\nindexes using the new database and blockchain infrastructure along with\ntwo concrete indexer implementations which provide both a\ntransaction-by-hash and a transaction-by-address index.\n\nThe new infrastructure is mostly separated into a package named indexers\nwhich is housed under the blockchain package.

Previously, when a wallet would\ndisconnect, rpcclient would hang and retry until a timeout would occur.\nInstead with the use of DisableAutoReconnect: true in rpcclient settings\nall connections are permentantly closed upon disconnect.\n\nWhile this avoids timeouts it does expose the stakepool to needing to\ngracefully handle the situation where some wallets are no longer available.\nThe new config option minservers (default: 2) offers stakepool admins\ncontrol over how many servers they require for errors not to be shown to\nuser in the event of disconnected wallets.  We feel 2/3 wallets\nconnected is sufficient for stakepool to proceed working as expected,\nthough anything below that may offer less than ideal situations for your\nuser (desync-ed votebits, address indices, and other possible corner cases\n between voting wallets).\n\nWith this new handling of wallet rpcclients, /status is now a place to\nlet admins see any issues with the connections to the voting wallets.\nIn the event of wallets going down the RPC Status: will update to\nEmergency (0 wallets), Critical (1 wallet), or Degraded (2 wallets).\nThis can be used in conjunction with html monitoring tools, so admins\ncan periodically poll /status and check what the current status is of\nthe wallet rpcclients and notify depending on circumstances.\n\n/status is now also used as a method to reconnect the wallets\nrpcclients.  For example, wallet 1 goes down and needs to be restarted.\nAdmin would restart the wallet then reload /status and stakepool would\nattempt to reconnect.  Each time a wallet is seen to be disconnected,\nany request to /status attempts to restart the connection.  We felt like\nthis, though not ideal, offered admins to set the aggresiveness of\nwallet reconnection as they deemed fit.\n\nAlso, an added *required* config option is adminips to limit access to\n/status to a list of IPs that the admins chooses.

Previously, when a wallet would\ndisconnect, rpcclient would hang and retry until a timeout would occur.\nInstead with the use of DisableAutoReconnect: true in rpcclient settings\nall connections are permentantly closed upon disconnect.\n\nWhile this avoids timeouts it does expose the stakepool to needing to\ngracefully handle the situation where some wallets are no longer available.\nThe new config option minservers (default: 2) offers stakepool admins\ncontrol over how many servers they require for errors not to be shown to\nuser in the event of disconnected wallets.  We feel 2/3 wallets\nconnected is sufficient for stakepool to proceed working as expected,\nthough anything below that may offer less than ideal situations for your\nuser (desync-ed votebits, address indices, and other possible corner cases\n between voting wallets).\n\nWith this new handling of wallet rpcclients, /status is now a place to\nlet admins see any issues with the connections to the voting wallets.\nIn the event of wallets going down the RPC Status: will update to\nEmergency (0 wallets), Critical (1 wallet), or Degraded (2 wallets).\nThis can be used in conjunction with html monitoring tools, so admins\ncan periodically poll /status and check what the current status is of\nthe wallet rpcclients and notify depending on circumstances.\n\n/status is now also used as a method to reconnect the wallets\nrpcclients.  For example, wallet 1 goes down and needs to be restarted.\nAdmin would restart the wallet then reload /status and stakepool would\nattempt to reconnect.
